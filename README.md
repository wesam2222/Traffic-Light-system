# Arduino Traffic Light System
This project is a simple traffic light system built using an Arduino board and three LEDs. The system simulates a traffic light by displaying a green light first, followed by a yellow light that flashes three times, and then a red light. This cycle repeats indefinitely.

# Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (Uno, Nano, or similar)
- Three LEDs (green, yellow, and red)
- Three 220 ohm resistors
- Breadboard or PCB for prototyping
- Jumper wires
# Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (or similar software for uploading code to the Arduino board)
# How to Use
1 - Connect the LEDs and resistors to the Arduino board as shown in the schematic (included in the repository).
2 - Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to the board.
3 - Power on the board and the traffic light system will begin cycling through the green, yellow, and red lights.
